# Genuary 2024 Repository

👉🏻 [My Collection](https://newisreal1.github.io/Genuary2024/)

This repository is dedicated to my participation in Genuary 2024, a creative challenge that encourages artists and programmers to create generative art based on daily prompts throughout the month of January. Genuary is a fantastic opportunity to explore the intersection of art and code, pushing the boundaries of creativity and computational thinking.

## About Genuary

Genuary is an annual event that provides a set of prompts for each day of January, challenging participants to create generative art using various programming tools and languages. The prompts are designed to inspire a wide range of interpretations and creative expressions. The goal is to foster a global community of artists and programmers exploring the possibilities of generative art.
